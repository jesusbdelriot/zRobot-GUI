# **zRobot GUI v1.0**
## Graphical User Interface for zRobot 1.0

Robots have been widely used in industrial environments, among other processes that need to be automated.

Despite the fact that there exists a GUIs for robots such as [RoboDK](https://robodk.com/) or [Robot Studio](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/robotstudio), their development is kind of complex and its usage is not modular, so this restricts its application to some specific models of robots.

However, with this GUI is possible to control the kinematics of a robot, and can be used in almost any system that has an ARM - based embedded system.

**Because of the current state of the art, this GUI do not intend to be an universal controller for all the robots, but it can be a good starting point for designing better systems** :smile:

This GUI uses the following libraries that improve the performance of the kinematics algorithms
 - [```tkinter```](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/tkinter.html), as the main GUI toolkit
 - [```multiprocessing```](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/multiprocessing.html), used to perform parallel computing of the inverse kinematics of the robot. This allows to get the most in the less time
 - [```threading```](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/threading.html), supports parallel processing for computing kinematics algorithms

## Example of Use

### COMING SOON (at least two weeks to develop the basic user's guide :wink:)

## We hope you can enjoy this material. Please, feel free to use it or update it as your needs demand
